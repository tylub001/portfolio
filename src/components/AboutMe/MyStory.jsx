        From serving at Disney, where I learned the art of creating memorable
        experiences, to sailing through the waters of Key West, embracing
        adventure and the rhythm of the ocean, my journey has been one of
        exploration and transformation. Now, I've anchored myself in coding,
        crafting immersive digital experiences with the same attention to detail
        and creativity. Whether navigating waves or debugging code, I thrive on
        problem-solving, adaptability, and the pursuit of seamless design.
