          When I first started my journey at TripleTen, I had little to no
          experience in coding. It felt like stepping into a completely new
          worldâ€”one filled with logic, creativity, and endless possibilities.
          But through persistence and hands-on learning, I have transformed from
          knowing nothing about web development to confidently working with
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, and more.
          <p>
            I've learned how to structure and style web pages, build dynamic and
            interactive applications, and manage state efficiently with modern
            tools. Debugging, problem-solving, and refining user experiences
            have become second nature, and each project pushes me to think
            critically and improve my skills. Now, I approach coding challenges with adaptability, embracing the
            process, and constantly learning to refine my craft. The journey has
            been transformative, and I'm excited to continue building and
            exploring new technologies!
